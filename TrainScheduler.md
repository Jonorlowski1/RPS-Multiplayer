# Welcome to the Train Scheduler!

## Always know when your train is arriving.

#### To use the scheduler, simply add your train name, the destination, the time the first train leaves, and how many minutes pass before each arrival. The math will work out the hard part for you and tell you when your next train is arriving!

#### Don't worry! This data is present across multiple devices and will not disappear if you leave the page. That way, you only have to run the math once, then check back in when you need it again.
